# Json Preprocessor\'s Package Description

## Getting Started

The JsonPreprocessor is a Python3 package which allows programmers to
handle additional features in json files such as

-   add comments
-   import other json files
-   overwrite already existing parameters with new values

These json files will be handled by the JsonPreprocessor which returns
as result a dictionary object of the deserialized data.

## How to install

Firstly, clone **python-jsonpreprocessor** repository to your machine.

Then go to python-jsonpreprocessor, using the 2 common commands below to
build or install this package:

``` 
setup.py build      will build the package underneath 'build/'
setup.py install    will install the package
```

After the build processes is completed, the package is located in
\'build/\', and the generated package documentation is located in
\'doc/\_build/\'.
